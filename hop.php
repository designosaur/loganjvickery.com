				<h2>House of Pizza - A Logo Design Case Study</h2>
					<p>The owners of House of Pizza allowed me to work with them on developing a logo for their new restuarant concept.  Some research of the competition was a first step in starting the project.</p><br>
					<a href="work/hop_research.jpg" ><img src="work/hop_research.jpg"></a><br><br>
					<p>Initial concepts were presented after receiving a very brief overview of the restaurant over the phone.</p><br>

					<p>Meeting with the clients in person to discuss the initial concepts allowed me to get a better understanding of the restaurant concept and a new direction was decided upon.  Some of the elements from the 1st round were incoporated into the 2nd round. A quick rendering helped the client visualize what the exterior sign might look like.</p><br>

					<p>The final color scheme and some minor detail changes were made before the final logo was handed over to the client.</p><br>
